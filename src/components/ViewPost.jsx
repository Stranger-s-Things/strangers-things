// The code can probably be different but I thought maybe to make things easier we could have the message
// poster and view post all on one component and then have it dynamically work to check if you are the poster
// if you are arent the poster it should have the functionality to message the poster
// IF you are the poster it should give you the option to edit or delete the post and view a list of all
//  messages sent to you for that post

export default function ViewPost() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>View Post</h1>
    </div>
  );
